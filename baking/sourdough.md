# Basic Sourdough

This is a reliable and straightforward sourdough recipe, based mostly on [Bake with Jack's](https://www.bakewithjack.co.uk/blog-1/2018/7/5/sourdough-loaf-for-beginners) recipe. He goes into much more detail on the process and has an excellent video demonstrating everything.

The numbers are a good amount for a single loaf. I often make two loaves and freeze one.
