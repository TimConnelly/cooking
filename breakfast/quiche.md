# Quiche 
AKA :egg: :pie: 

The key to this recipe is the ricotta. It gives a reliably fluffy texture.

This is typically better the next day. To reheat, cut slices and place in frying pan and cover on medium heat. 

## Ingredients
### Basics
1. Pie crust
    - For quiche, I just buy crusts from the store and save the crust making for apple pie. Pillsbury is reliable.
1. 7-8 eggs
    - I start with 7 and add an extra at the end if needed to cover the filling.
1. Parmesan cheese - a few spoonfuls.
1. 8 oz Whole milk ricotta cheese.

### Filling
There's room to play with the fillings. Here's a list common choices. Pre-cook fillings with and asterisk. The directions will use broccoli and cheddar, because that's what I make most often.
- Broccoli (small head) and cheddar (as much as you like).
- Spinach*, mushroom* and feta.

## Directions
1. Heat oven to 350 F.
1. Prepare the filling. Cut broccoli florets into 1/2" to 1" florets. Cut the cheddar into 1/4" cubes.
1. Roll out crust and place into a pie dish. Ideally, the crust slightly hangs over the edges. Dock the crust with a fork. 
1. When the oven reaches 350 F, pre-bake the crust for about 10 minutes. Keep an eye out for large bubbles. If there are any, pop them with the fork. It doesn't 
1. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs. Then mix in the ricotta, parmesan and season with salt and pepper and beat everything together. 
    - This step can be done earlier in the process.
1. Remove the pre-baked crust.
1. Pour about half the egg mixture into the pie crust. Then spread the broccoli and cheddar evenly on top of the egg mixture. Then pour the remaining egg mixture over the filling. If the filling isn't completely covered, beat another egg and pour over the top.
1. Bake for 50-60 minutes until a toothpick, or knife, inserted into the center comes out clean (except for any cheese).
1. Let cool for at least 15 minutes for the structure to finish setting up. Longer is better.
